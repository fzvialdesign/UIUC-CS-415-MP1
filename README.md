# UIUC-CS-415-MP1
Unreal Engine project that encapsulates a 3D endless runner experience made for my first MP for CS 415 at UIUC

This Unreal Engine project was my final submission for the second machine project, the assignment being titled as "Your First Game: An Infinite Matrix." This assignment was conducted over the course of about a couple of weeks. It involved completing a tutorial by Kodeco, adding a health system, a score system, consumable health packs, player projectile attacks, enemies, increasing speed, and a unique modification of my own. Further details can be found in the Submission Video. For this assignment, I received a grade of 98%, which can be seen in the Grade Screenshot.

Disclaimer: The final allowable submission date has long passed, so the ability to use this code to submit the assignment for a grade this current semester of Spring 2024 has similarly passed. I do not condone usage of this project for the purposes of cheating if this exact type of project assignment is to be re-used in future iterations of CS 415 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
